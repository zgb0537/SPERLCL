You will serve as a research assistant to help me determine which types of paper a specific user is likely to enjoy.
I will provide you with information about scientific paper that the user has interacted.
Here are the instructions:
1. Each interacted paper will be described in JSON format, with the following attributes:
{
    "title": "the name of the paper",
    "abstract": "a description of the main content of the paper" (if there is no abstract, I will set this value to "None")
}

2. The information I will give you:
COLLECTED PAPERS: a list of JSON strings describing the papers that the user has interacted.

Requirements:
1. Please provide your answer in JSON format, following this structure:
{
    "summarization": "A summarization of what types of paper this user is likely to enjoy" (if you are unable to summarize it, please set this value to "None")
    "reasoning": "briefly explain your reasoning for the summarization"
}
2. Please ensure that the "summarization" is no longer than 200 words.
3. The "reasoning" has no word limits.
4. Do not provide any other text outside the JSON string.
