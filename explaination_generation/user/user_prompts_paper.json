{"prompt": {"COLLECTED PAPERS": [{"title": " Information diffusion through blogspace ", "abstract": "We study the dynamics of information propagation in environments of low-overhead personal publishing  using a large collection of weblogs over time as our example domain. We characterize and model this collection at two levels. First  we present a macroscopic characterization of topic propagation through our corpus  formalizing the notion of long-running &#34;chatter&#34; topics consisting recursively of &#34;spike&#34; topics generated by outside world events  or more rarely  by resonances within the community. Second  we present a microscopic characterization of propagation from individual to individual  drawing on the theory of infectious diseases to model the flow. We propose  validate  and employ an algorithm to induce the underlying propagation network from a sequence of posts  and report on the results."}, {"title": " Blogging as social activity  or  would you let 900 million people read your diary?", "abstract": "None"}, {"title": " Visualising the social dynamics of team collaboration ", "abstract": "The aim of this research is to develop automated computational methods that visualise a particular social dimension of teamwork  the mutual expectations and shared knowledge that form the basis for effective collaborative work  to better facilitate its accurate analysis and interpretation. This teamwork dimension is operationalised as conceptual coherence  which is imputed from the semantic coherence of team communication. This paper presents three different information visualisation techniques for representing the social dynamics of design team collaboration based on the content of their communication. This collection of data representations was developed using a custom-made software toolkit that merges computational linguistic and information visualisation algorithms. Based on this research  several teamwork visualisation guidelines have been derived in order to transform the communications of design teams into useful devices for quantifying and representing social accounting metrics concerning the level and quality of their collaborative interactions over time."}, {"title": " Substitution Patterns Are Under Different Influences in Primates and Rodents ", "abstract": "There are large-scale variations of the GC-content along mammalian chromosomes that have been called isochore structures. Primates and rodents have different isochore structures  which suggests that these lineages exhibit different modes of GC-content evolution. It has been shown that  in the human lineage  GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC)  a neutral process associated with meiotic recombination  acts on GC-content evolution by influencing A or T to G or C substitution rates. We computed genome-wide substitution patterns in the mouse lineage from multiple alignments and compared them with substitution patterns in the human lineage. We found that in the mouse lineage  gBGC is active but weaker than in the human lineage and that male-specific recombination better predicts GC-content evolution than female-specific recombination. Furthermore  we were able to show that G or C to A or T substitution rates are predicted by a combination of different factors in both lineages. A or T to G or C substitution rates are most strongly predicted by meiotic recombination in the human lineage but by CpG odds ratio (the observed CpG frequency normalized by the expected CpG frequency) in the mouse lineage  suggesting that substitution patterns are under different influences in primates and rodents."}]}}
