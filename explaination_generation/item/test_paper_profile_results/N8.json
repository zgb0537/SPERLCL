"<think>\nAlright, so I'm trying to figure out how to summarize this paper titled \"Finnish (Finno-Ugric)\" since there's no abstract provided. Hmm, okay, first things first, the title gives me a clue that it's about the Finnish language, and specifically mentioning Finno-Ugric suggests it might cover the broader language family.\n\nSince I don't have an abstract, I'll need to make some educated guesses. The paper is likely focused on linguistic aspects of Finnish, maybe its structure, grammar, vocabulary, or perhaps its relation to other Finno-Ugric languages like Hungarian or Estonian. It could also delve into historical linguistics, exploring the origins and evolution of the language.\n\nThinking about who would enjoy this paper... Well, linguists specializing in Uralic languages would definitely be interested. Students studying Finnish or linguistic typology might find it valuable too. Language enthusiasts with a passion for Finno-Ugric languages could also appreciate it, especially if they're looking to understand deeper linguistic structures beyond just vocabulary.\n\nI should structure the summarization to mention that it's about the language's linguistic aspects and its relation to other Finno-Ugric languages. Then, identify the target audience as linguists, students, and enthusiasts in that area. Keep it concise within 200 words for the summary and explain my reasoning briefly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"summarization\": \"This paper focuses on the Finnish language, specifically its linguistic features and its place within the Finno-Ugric language family.
